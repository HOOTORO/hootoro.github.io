I just fell in love with this game. Versatility and detailed storylines, with instant reaction on player actions is beyond imageable. Whoever made this scenario hell possible, they're freaking geniuses.

The main thing I like about [b]BM[/b] is devs themselves. 
Since HL was first discovered when the insta-loved sequel came out. It also brought a feeling of incompleteness, as original game outdated engine crucially nullify the desire to play it.
But thank goodness, back in 2005, [i]a devil's dozen of true fans[/i], [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_the_Round_Table]Developers of the Crowbar Collective[/url], now [b]true heroes[/b], made it possible to enjoy the original story on a fully functional Source engine.
For they are truly, Freeman's apostles, charged with proclaiming the black mesa gospel to the xen world, for the sake of us all lost children,  of all the suffering, all the struggling. just like myself.

[h3]What about game then?[/h3]

Well, what do you think you are looking at? standalone game?  Mod?  Expansion?
No, not even close.
Let me clear things up a bit...

Bet at least in childhood you had such a joyful feeling, sometimes warm and tender, sometimes bright, hot, but not harmful/burning, rather omnipotent...
so beautiful, so familiar... [spoiler]the so-called love, a mother's love.[/spoiler]
Inevitable, unconditional, boundless, blind and always close.
Whatever happens to you, if necessary, it easily knocks out any crap and brings tranquility.
There is a similar vibe, you can feel it by just by playing.

Despite being Gabe's [b]forsaken children[/b], like all of us, HL3 believers, crestfallen. 
Much betold, twice behold, once believe, never forgive, those who can't count to 3.

But jokes aside, think carefully.

Back in 2005 literally [u]volunteers[/u] goal to [b]completely recreate[/b] Half-Life using Source.
And next 7 years (sic!) the devs worked in their spare time for free, for the sake of the community. Just like that. With no intention to profit someday, at all, principally.

[quote=wiki]
In the lead-up to the 2012 release, team member Carlos Montero said that in 2009 that they thought they were going to be able to make that date, but "ended up busting our asses to make that a reality, and we went against a lot of our core values in the process. We found ourselves rushing things, cutting things, making quality sacrifices we did not want to make." Montero said then they decided to re-evaluate the state of the project, set higher bars for the quality of work they wanted to produce, and started to back through what they had already done to improve upon that, at which point they were not sure when the project would be completed.

[spoiler]Even a well-paid part-time second job is still [b]second job[/b], especially in the long run, a hellish task, exhausting both physically and mentally.[/spoiler] 
Remotely, because team all over the world.

So the global trend of remote work and the accompanying optimal tools (figma, trello, etc.) are still ahead.
[quote=Adam Engels, project lead]
We use chat programs and online forums, we try and use chat to work out specific problems, then use forums to document what we talked about so we can refer to it later. Time zones are one of the biggest hurdles for such a disconnected team, and it’s basically impossible to get everyone together at once.
We try to schedule a few meetings or playtests where everyone can get involved. We’ve been using Google Docs recently and they’ve been a huge help.
[/quote]

Just try to imagine how dedicated, motivated, selfless devs must be?
How much [i]passion, patience and obv [b]love[/b][/i] for creation, they have and put into [b]BM[/b]? 
Can you? Me neither. Only feel.

As you may know, final [u]polished[/u] version was [i]released in 2020[/i].

Milestones all together briefly:

[olist]
    [*] [7 years] resulted first playable release (free)
    [*] [3 years] is about transition to commercial release. Since steam introduced in 2012 Greenlight. Where BM quickly became one of most wanted games. Meanwhile Valve released first commercial version of Source engine. So in order to use full features devs required licence. Shortly after:
        [quote=wikipedia]
            Valve approached their team around this time and suggested making Black Mesa a commercial release and, thus, getting a license to the Source engine. The team considered this option, and, since access to the full Source engine would help make Black Mesa the best game they could, opted to go the commercial route to be able to pay for that license, not having originally intended to profit from the game. By November, 2013, the team had affirmed that they had gotten Valve's permission to sell the game.
        [/quote]
    [*] [5 years] Transitioning from a team of volunteers to a team working on an Early Access project, with a responsibility to the customers who spent money on it, was a really big commitment. But besides licence, enabled possibility to actually hire people with skills specific to the Source engine so impacted Xen implementing a lot.  
[/olist]

Concluded total 15 years of development. Leaded by main principal [i]quality over speed[/i] till the very end. So "when it's done".
[url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-story-of-half-life-remake-black-mesa/]
[quote=PCGamer]
    In November 2015 the team even visited Valve’s HQ in Bellevue, Washington. "A number of past and present developers were able to make it," says Engels. "It’s hard to speak for everyone at Valve, but the company must like us a little if it’s allowing us to do this project." Not many game companies would allow something like Black Mesa to exist, let alone be sold on its own distribution platform. But the quality, polish and passion of Black Mesa obviously won Valve over.
[/quote]
[/url]

And I personally think CC is seriously undervaluing themselves here. 
Once Valve's managing director Gabe Newell is quoted as saying that a complete Source remake of Half-Life by its fans was [i]"not only possible…but inevitable"[/i], so permission to sell the game was least that can be done by father. Not to mention, Valve's double tax: distribution, license.
So it's more like free money to Valve, why not, a gift from forsaken children.
That said, do not know nothing how rewarding in profit terms it ended for those devil's dozen of pure volunteers, totally sure they deserve even more.
[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_(video_game)]
[quote=wikipedia]
    In 2014, Black Mesa was named by PC Gamer among the "Ten top fan remade classics you can play for free right now"
[/quote]
[/url]
PC Gamer as usual. Funny nonsense. 
"among" they say, if there are fan remakes of classics at least half as good as "BM". Well, prove me wrong.
All the more nine, you say? I would happy give in even by 5. 
And would gladly play those games that I don't know.

[h2]Now you know that [b]BM[/b] was made by the beloved children of humanity[/h2]
If you into HL, there is no chance you can dislike BM.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]OVERALL IMPRESSION[/h2]

[quote=GR_steamstore_states]
Ghostrunner is a [u]hardcore[/u] FPP slasher packed with lightning-fast action, set in a grim, cyberpunk megastructure
[/quote]

Commonly such descriptions is done by publishers and contains various marketing gimmicks, to increase sales. So description relevancy to actual game content lost it lead role. As last games FromSomeoncegamedevnow3Ddesignstudio as example.
Surprisingly rare case for official description when every single word fits into the description with utmost precision.
But the very best experience game could give is beyond casual FPS skillset, tho Bhop mastery sufficient.
If you get here, 90% sure the reason is ton of magnificent gifs with brutal npc elimination by ninja swiftly traversing longass gaps.

Must say first and most [u]crucial[/u] thing to understand about game:
Despite it has [i]casual[/i] and [b]hardcore[/b] mode...
[code]casual ≠ easy[/code]
So even casual one is still very challenging and require non-trivial skills in order gameplay became satisfying and enjoyable.
Due to game's [u]fast-paced nature[/u] itself which initially set difficulty [i]beyond[/i] casual level on it's own.
Gameplay in general dominated by principle: "if you stop, you're probably dead", but usually, to die, it is enough to be not fast enough.
No surprises this doesn't suits everyone by far.
[b]Strongly recommended to take that into consideration, before spend $[/b].

On the other hand, improving your skills brings with it a next level of joy. [u]Therefore very satisfying[/u].
GR is a perfect example of what hardcore games should be. Even for the developers of GR.
Meanwhile, the original game, worthy of epithets like legendary, phenomenal, brilliant work of Art and no less, no discuss.
Sequel introduced a brand-new "Tetris" mechanic that allows to create incredibly powerful builds.
It's may be fun, but with "deflect technique" expanded to "blocking ability" on top of that, it actually lowers the "skill issue" dramatically, making the sequel more casual.
Therefore lost all aesthetical appealing.

Before updating the review, I looked at other reviews on the game store page.
I suspect that many may disagree with these epithets or can/want to argue. But this is quite natural and there is no room for debate.
Seen some folks was disappointed there is no way to save mid level, admit it may seems reasonable, trust me, that's until traversing from start of whatever given map to whatever you wish on average ~1-2 min. Inbounds.
[spoiler] i.e. through intended route, without any abuses, using game featured mechanics in designed way [/spoiler]
In that precious moment also should come realisation that "save mid-level" neverever was an option, likely even joke-wise
So let's be honest, original GR was build by dedicated tryhards for tryhards and that's awesome!

But who is tryhards from economy pov?
Assuming Gaussian distribution suits(it is), most likely ~5% of the gamedev market, implied tryhards as values in two or more standard deviations. Therefore, originally the expected profit correspond product whom target audience is approx. 5%.
In fact, devs done a great, almost impossible job to made learning-mastery process least painful as possible, while maintain important hc concepts.
More importantly devs built a high-quality product easy exceeds the expected ~5%. So naturally when casual masses became stakeholder, in order to kept and grow customers base GR2 answer it casuality request.

If you ever ask yourself why most difficult games, literally had hard as it's core, looks like indie-games or so, well reasons is here. In general people don't likes complex stuff, always at your service Captain Obvious.
But no matter what, famous gamedev studios always have at least one signature title, you know, like

    [*] Blizzard - classic trio WC, D, SC
    [*] Square Enix - FF series
