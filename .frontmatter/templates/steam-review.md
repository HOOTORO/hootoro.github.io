    [*] [b][i]Story[/i][/b] ⚓|📜 After 1k h, not sure is see at least half of the stories that BG3 hides. Drudge <3
    [*] [b][i]Visual Design[/i][/b] 🎬| 10 disgust sh faces/10. Sometimes emotions on those faces are priceless xD 
    [*] [b][i]Soundtrack[/i][/b] 🎼| Overall good, but sometimes it feels like there's not enough variety
    [*] [b][i]Complexity[/i][/b] 💢| It depends. The game has very flexible difficulty settings. From ezbreezy to, well, honour is H2L|H2M.
    [*] [b][i]Performance[/i][/b] 🖥️| As for me everything is good. But I'm not sophisticated either.
    [*] [b][i]Price[/i][/b] 💸| Seems honest to me, game totally worth it! GOTY

I just fell in love with this game. Versatility and detailed storylines, with instant reaction on player actions is beyond imageable. Whoever made this scenario hell possible, they're freaking geniuses.
To make it clear. The game gives you whole freedom to do whatever you want.No matter what cringy stuff you do, story will  adapt, naturally. Never seen like before.

Well, no matter how you look at it, Larian did a great job. They set very ambitious goals and achieved them. Such a large-scale work obviously has some small problems. But these are so minor. So can be skipped entirely.
For history and research sake only
[list]
    [*] [i]minor[/i] | broken scrolls: Outiluke sphere(Conjure Elemental), when cast via context menu cast options doesn't appear. (Workaround cast directly from hotbar)
    [*] [i]minor[/i] | mage armor(scroll) doesn't count in equipment(mb only visual bug)
    [*] [i]minor[/i] | Wyrm Fortress: If gortash was killed on coronation all area became (obviously) hostile, but when flee from battle and return through first floor, second joins battle too, and cannot get downstairs.
    [*] [i]minor[/i] | Wulbren missing from cave in Rivington(mb because I get there after killin Gortash), but all NPC around talk like he is here.

If you didn't play BG3, you don't know what RPG actually is. [b]Strongly recommended.[/b]

Well it's really hard to describe what you get playing this work of art.
When you see how the game was made, you feel that this work was done with deep passion and love for games and the community.
Thank you, Kojima-dono! ❤️
